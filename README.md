# Peltier_Stage

This project is inspired by [flyBridge](https://ptweir.github.io/flyBridge/) from Peter Weir.

This project aims to replace an expensive temperature controller ([TC-48-20](https://tetech.com/product/tc-48-20/)) used in the original flyBridge project by integrating different commercially available parts onto a single PCB.
